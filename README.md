Discord Rich Presence</h3>

## About The Project

Games often integrate Discord Rich Presence (RPC) to enhance the gaming experience and allow players to showcase their in-game activities to friends and communities on Discord. Discord RPC offers several benefits:

- Enhanced Social Interaction: Discord RPC allows players to share their current in-game status, such as what game they are playing, their current level, achievements, and more. This enhances social interaction among players, as friends can see what their friends are playing and join them if they wish.
- Promotion and Exposure: Discord has a large user base, and integrating with Discord RPC can help games gain exposure and attract new players. When players showcase their in-game activities on Discord, it can pique the interest of their friends and encourage them to try the game as well.

I'm more interested in the promotion and exposure aspect, so that's why I coded it in the first place!
